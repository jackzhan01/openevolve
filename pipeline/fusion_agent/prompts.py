COMMON_TRITON_MISTAKES = """## Common Triton mistakes to avoid

- `tl.arange` bounds must be compile-time constants. Do not write
  `tl.arange(0, N)` when `N` is a runtime tensor dimension. Use a
  `BLOCK_*: tl.constexpr` parameter and mask with `offs < N`.
- Do not read Python globals inside `@triton.jit` kernels. Pass `eps`, strides,
  dimensions, and other scalars as kernel arguments.
- For reductions, reduce over exactly the dimensions specified by the AtenIR
  graph metadata. Do not infer reduction axes from output names or local
  variable names.
- Do not hard-code traced dimensions such as 64, 128, or 256 unless they are
  semantically constant in the graph. Derive runtime dimensions from input
  tensor shapes and use masks for tail elements.
- Tile sizes must cover the runtime extent being processed. If a runtime
  dimension can exceed the initial trace size, compute a power-of-two
  `BLOCK_*` from that runtime dimension on the Python launch side and mask
  inactive lanes. Do not process only the first fixed tile of a larger tensor.
- Every `tl.zeros`, `tl.full`, and `tl.arange` shape element must be a
  `tl.constexpr` integer. Never use a runtime scalar/tensor dimension directly
  as a Triton block shape.
- If using `tl.atomic_add`, initialize the destination tensor first and make
  sure the atomic accumulation axis matches the graph's reduction semantics.
- Output dtypes must match the public API contract. If accumulation uses fp32,
  allocate outputs with `torch.empty_like` / `torch.zeros_like` of the requested
  output tensor when possible, or explicitly cast before returning.
- For dynamic shapes, derive shapes/strides at runtime in Python, but pass
  tile sizes as `tl.constexpr` meta-parameters to Triton kernels.

The AtenIR backward graph below is already verified by primitive composition.
Your task is to propose a semantic-preserving fusion plan that groups nodes into
a small number of Triton kernels. Do not optimize launch parameters yet.
The generated program must support both float32 and float16 inputs; reductions
should accumulate in fp32 and outputs should match the input/parameter dtypes.

    return f"""# Backward Fusion Codegen

Generate a complete Python module implementing:

```python
{api_signature}
    {return_contract}
```

Requirements:

- Use Triton kernels for the fused backward implementation.
- Preserve the semantics of the AtenIR graph.
- Use fp32 accumulation for reductions.
- Support both float32 and float16 input tensors. Do not reject float16 tensors.
- Preserve the output order and shapes specified by the public API contract.
- Return gradient tensors with the dtype of the corresponding primal tensor when
  there is a direct primal; for scalar-only gradients, use the dtype implied by
  the incoming gradient tensor.
- Allocate outputs with `torch.empty_like` / `torch.zeros_like` where possible so
  stores cast back to the expected dtype.
- Do not check that inputs are exactly `torch.float32`; only require CUDA floating tensors.
- Include an `EVOLVE-BLOCK` around generated Triton kernels and launch helpers.
- Do not call PyTorch autograd or high-level PyTorch reference operators in the
  generated backward.
- Return only Python source code, no Markdown.

formula error. Then fix the root cause in the source code; do not make cosmetic
changes that leave the same formula and tiling structure intact.
